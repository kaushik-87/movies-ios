 This application is designed and developed to list the upcoming movies using TMDB API.
 
 Application has two main screens:
 
 1. List of Movies
 2. Details of the selcted Movie. 
 
 For this application we are restricting the movie list count to 50. All the movies are sorted by the release date in ascending order.
 In the list view each movie is displayed in a row with title, poster image, genres and release date. 
 
 Selecting on each row navigates to detailed screen. Detailed screen displays Movie title, bigger poster image, genres, release date and oveview about the movie.
 
 The application is desgined in such a way that it can be extensible for handling more number of movies and also can be sorted using other parameters like name, popularity etc.
